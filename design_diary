Creating a roguelike seemed like a descent challenge considering that I've never used pygame before. Overally, I'm happy with 
the progress I've made so far. I managed to get a player controller working, and create levels using sprites. My next goal is to 
create enemies, a combat system, exp system, etc. Should be fun.
